## The ECS crate for HNZ

The main purpose of this crate is to provide a simple and efficient way to implement an Entity Component System (ECS) in Rust.
Our ECS is designed to minimize the amout of storages required to maintain a set of entities, while providing a fast way to
access entities that possess a specific set of components.

Check out the memory sub crate for more information [memory](https://github.com/Hennzau/hnz/blob/main/ecs/src/memory/).

You can see some examples of how to use the ECS in the examples in the directory [examples](https://github.com/Hennzau/hnz/blob/main/examples/).
