# hnz

HNZ is the toolkit i'm currently developing. It is a collection of crates that are designed to help me build applications in Rust.
It could be to build a game, or a desktop application. My goal is to make it as easy as possible to build applications in Rust.

I want the ECS paradigm to be the core of my toolkit. In this regard i'm developing a ECS crate that is designed to be simple and
efficient. The ECS crate is designed to minimize the amout of storages required to maintain a set of entities, while providing a
fast way to access entities that possess a specific set of components.

Check out the ecs crate for more information [ecs](https://github.com/Hennzau/hnz/blob/main/README.md)
